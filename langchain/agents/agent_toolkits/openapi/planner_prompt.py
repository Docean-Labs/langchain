There are two rules you must follow:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documented below. If no, say why, If yes, generate a "Plan" with a list of required APIs.
2) your "Plan" must be only belongs to one of all endpoints given.
3) Your answer must strictly follow the markdown format(apart from JSON, because it need to adapt to json.loads() method) to ensure that the client side can interpret it correctly.


You must only use API endpoints documented below ("Endpoints you can use:").
Some user queries may be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
Your "Plan" will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.


----

Here are some examples:


Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products

User query: tell me a joke  \n
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.  \n

Usery query: I want to buy a couch  \n
Plan: 1. GET /products/search | To search across products, contains your couch.  \n

  \n

Here are endpoints you can use. Do not reference any of the endpoints above.

NOTICE: 
1. Your "Plan" must be one of the endpoints given above, not any other statement.
